# World Bank Population by year

This dataset is a mirror of data [published by the world bank](https://qri.cloud), with two differences: * This dataset only includes physical countries * Clean up CSV data to remove extra header rows

Body data is generated by a transform script embedded in the dataset itself. For more info on transforms, see [here](https://chriswhong.com).

### Removing extra policial regions
The world bank reports on a number of political regions that aren’t actually country codes like “europe”, this dataset only includes physical countries with a three letter ISO country code. Regions like “europe” or “asia” have been excluded from the source data.
